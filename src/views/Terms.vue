              Informal Resolution It our goal that the App meets your
              expectations and we live up to our promises to you. However, there
              may be instances when you feel that we have not fulfilled its
              obligations or you may have a different type of problem or dispute
              that needs special attention. In those instances, we are committed
              to working with you to reach a reasonable resolution that
              satisfies you; however, we can only do this if we know about and
              understand your issue. Therefore, for any problem or dispute that
              you may have with us, you acknowledge and agree that you will
              first give FlyLine an opportunity to resolve your problem or
              dispute. In order to initiate this dispute resolution process, you
              must first send us a written description of your problem or
              dispute within thirty (30) days of the event causing the dispute
              by sending us an email to support@joinFlyLine.com. You then agree
              to negotiate with FlyLine in good faith about your problem or
              dispute. This should lead to resolution, but if for some reason
              your problem or dispute is not resolved satisfactorily within
              sixty (60) days after FlyLine’s receipt of your written
              description of it, you agree to the further arbitration provisions
              below. BINDING ARBITRATION Arbitration Proceeding. Any dispute,
              claim or controversy arising out of or relating to this Agreement
              or the breach, termination, enforcement, interpretation or
              validity thereof, including the determination of the scope or
              applicability of this Agreement to arbitrate, shall be determined
              by arbitration in Dallas, Texas before three arbitrators. The
              arbitration shall be administered by JAMS pursuant to its
              Comprehensive Arbitration Rules and Procedures and in accordance
              with the Expedited Procedures in those Rules. Judgment on the
              Award may be entered in any court having jurisdiction. ANY
              ARBITRATION UNDER THIS AGREEMENT SHALL TAKE PLACE ON AN INDIVIDUAL
              BASIS. CLASS ACTION AND CLASS ARBITRATIONS ARE NOT PERMITTED. YOU

              RIGHT TO PARTICIPATE IN CLASS ACTIONS. This clause shall not
              preclude parties from seeking provisional remedies in aid of
              arbitration from a court of appropriate jurisdiction. Exceptions
              to Arbitration. You and FlyLine agree that the following claims
              are not subject to the above provisions concerning negotiations
              and binding arbitration: (a) any claim seeking to enforce or
              protect, or concerning the validity of, any of FlyLine’s
              intellectual property rights; (b) any claim related to, or arising
              from, allegations of theft, piracy, invasion of privacy or
              unauthorized use; and (c) any claim for equitable relief. In
              addition to the foregoing, either party may assert an individual
              action in small claims court for claims that are within the scope
              of such court’s jurisdiction in lieu of arbitration. 30-Day Right
              to Opt-Out. You have the right to opt-out and not be bound by the
              arbitration and class action waiver provisions set forth above by
              sending written notice of your decision to opt-out to the address
              listed below. The notice must be sent within 30 days of your first
              use of the Service, otherwise you shall be bound to arbitrate
              disputes in accordance with the terms of those paragraphs. If you
              opt-out of these arbitration provisions, FlyLine also will not be
              bound by them. Severability. If any provision of this Agreement
              illegal or unenforceable under applicable law, the remainder of
              the provision will be amended to achieve as closely as possible
              the effect of the original term and all other provisions of this
              Agreement will continue in full force and effect. Governing Law.

              case located in Dallas, Texas. You waive any and all objections to

              in such courts. Limitation of Time to File Claims. ANY CAUSE OF
